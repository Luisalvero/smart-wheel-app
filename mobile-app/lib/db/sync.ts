/**
 * Pushes locally recorded drives to Supabase.
 *
 * Design rules this follows, in order of importance:
 *
 * 1. **Local SQLite is the source of truth.** Sync is a background convenience.
 *    A failed upload must never lose or alter a recorded drive, so nothing here
 *    deletes local rows — it only advances `sync_status`.
 * 2. **Idempotent by construction.** Every row already carries a phone-generated
 *    UUID, so uploads are `upsert`s keyed on that id. Re-running after a partial
 *    failure re-sends the same rows harmlessly; no duplicates, no ID remapping.
 * 3. **Parents before children.** Profiles, then sessions, then telemetry, so a
 *    foreign key never points at a row that has not landed yet.
 * 4. **Manual catch-up.** The active session is streamed by liveSync.ts; this
 *    uploads whatever that missed (drives recorded offline, failed pushes).
 *    The app stays fully usable with the radio off either way.
