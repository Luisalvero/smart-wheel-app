/**
 * Deleting data -- on this phone AND in Supabase.
 *
 *   deleteDriverEverywhere   a driver, all their drives, readings, alerts and
 *                            waveform archives
 *   deleteDriveEverywhere    one drive (session)
 *   wipeEverything           every driver this phone knows about
 *
 * Local rows go first and immediately (SQLite cascades from the profile).
 * Then the cloud: the row delete cascades through drive_sessions →
 * telemetry_events / drive_alerts / session_archives (ON DELETE CASCADE in
 * schema.sql / v3_dashboard.sql), and the .ppga files are removed from the
 * 'session-archives' bucket (needs supabase/v5_delete.sql for the Storage
 * delete policy).
 *
 * Offline? The cloud part is queued (app_settings 'pending_deletes') and
 * retried by processPendingDeletes() at start-up and on every manual sync, so
 * a deletion is never silently forgotten.
 *
 * Scope: only records this phone created/knows. A teammate's drivers on
 * another phone are never touched.
